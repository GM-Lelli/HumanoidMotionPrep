# DebugDataVisualization

This module is dedicated to the **visualization of animation data** applied to a humanoid SMPL model within Unity. The main goal is to verify that the numerical data extracted from an `AnimationClip`—generated by the **MoMask** model—is correctly interpreted and visually represented in a coherent way.

## Module Contents

### `SkeletonMapper.cs`

This class acts as a **mapping between the logical names of humanoid joints and their corresponding `Transform`s in the scene**. It holds references to the model’s main body parts (pelvis, spine, limbs, head) and initializes an ordered list (`bodyPart`) useful for systematically accessing each joint. It serves as a structural support for other components.

### `PlayAnimationOnHumanoid.cs`

This class manages the **visual playback of an animation**. It receives a set of joint rotations (for example from a manager like `HumanoidCloningManager`), applies them to the humanoid model through the `Transform`s defined in `SkeletonMapper`, and synchronizes the playback using a defined frame rate.

- ✅ Enables **frame-by-frame visualization** of joint animations.
- ✅ Useful for comparing raw animation data with the visual result.

### `DrawHumanoidSkeletonGizmos.cs`

This class uses **Gizmos to draw the skeletal structure** of the humanoid in the scene, visually connecting the various joints. It is designed to provide a quick overview of the **topology and structural consistency** of the humanoid rig.

- ✅ Editor-only functionality.
- ✅ Useful for debugging the joint structure.

## Usage

1. Ensure your GameObject (SMPL model) includes a `SkeletonMapper` component with correctly assigned `Transform`s.
2. Add the `PlayAnimationOnHumanoid` component to play an animation loaded from an external manager.
3. (Optional) Add `DrawHumanoidSkeletonGizmos` to visualize the skeletal structure using Gizmos.

## Purpose

The `DebugDataVisualization` system is designed to support:
- Visual validation of animation data during preprocessing.
- Debugging of humanoid model structure and movement.
- Integration with animation tools based on AI (e.g., Behavior Cloning, Reinforcement Learning).

---

## Dependencies

- Requires the `HumanoidCloningManager` component to load animation data (see `AgentBehavior`).
